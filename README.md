This is an adventure game excercise from Learning Ruby the Hard Way

I'm attempting to use classes and inheritance to create a dungeon from objects
The project is split into 3 files
	'adventure.rb' main loop
	'class_definition.rb' define classes
	'dungeon_setup.rb' function to populate dungeon with data (could be prettier)

At present player can move between rooms,  pick up/drop objects, show inventory and quit
