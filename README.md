## Summary

Pre-course adventure game excercise from Learning Ruby the Hard Way

### Problem

User moves between rooms in a dungeon, interacts with objects and monsters

### Languages/Platforms/Tools

| Languages | Technologies  | Testing Frameworks| Misc
| :-------------------------------------------- |:--------------|:-----------|:----|
| Ruby      |               |  no tests                |               |
|           |               |                   |               |
|           |               |                   |  
|           |               |

### Solution

* The player can move between rooms, pick up and manipulate items, and shoot the monster.
* Room, item and monster Classes inherit off Dungeon_thing generic class
* A big classless loop handles the game mechanics


### Setup
```
ruby adventure.rb
```


### Tests
no tests

### Images
```
You are in a cluttered kitchen, light streams in through the window.
there is an exit N to dining room
you see item toast
you see monster angry Hobgoblin

please enter instruction (verb, noun)
get toast
you pick up toast
```
### To do

* Methods are too long
* Lacks game object

### Learning points

* Learned about class inheritance
* Control flow and parsing text input
* Rewriting the exercise was useful - improved each time
